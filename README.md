# protect-branch

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that automatically protects the default (often `master`) branch of a newly created repository within an organization and alerts the repository creator of the protection.

## Setup

Probot applications can be [deployed](https://probot.github.io/docs/deployment/) from a handful of locations such as Glitch, Heroku, Now, and others. The following setup instructions are for getting the Probot application up and running locally for proof-of-concept testing or general interest.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
1. From the cloned repository folder use the following commands:

```sh
# To install dependencies run:
npm install

# To initiate the bot
npm start
```

For assistance with errors encountered while using the `npm` commands, I found the following helpful:
